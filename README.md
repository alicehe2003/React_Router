# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Resources 

This example is done following the Odin Project. The purpose is to demonstrate the usage of a React router. 

To set up the React template in a GitHub repo, cd into the repo and enter:
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react

To run: 
npm run dev
